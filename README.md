# Covid19_Data_Analysis and Data_Visualisation
In this course, I have work with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also, I have another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. I have merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
Apart of this I have use COVID19 dataset we have consisting of data-related cumulative number of confirmed, recovered, and deaths cases.I have prepare this dataset to answer these questions: How does Global Spread of the virus look like? How intensive the spread of the virus has been in the countries? Does covid19 national lockdowns and self-isolations in different countries have actually impact on COVID19 transmission? I have used Plotly module, which is a great visualization tool in python, in order to plot some insightful and intuitive graphs to answer the questions.
