# Covid19_Data_Analysis
In this course, I have work with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also, I have another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. I have merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
